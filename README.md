This is a project for a website for a studio for yoga and dance classes. 
Through it the end-customer can check what are the different classes, information about them and the trainers, information about the prices and contact details.
Also they can make reservations for each class or to assign on a waitlist in case the class is already full.


•	Cloudinary used for images upload.
•	The application must have a private part - Students page which only appears to Receptionists (standard view) and Moderators/Superadmins(API).
•	Creating asynchronous view/s - make_reservation and cancel_reservation views in schedule app.
•	Testing - tests for Schedule model and ScheduleView
